My name is Mahin Alam; I am a student of Meng-Civil Engineering program at the University of Windsor. 
My areas of interest are Material, Sustainability, and Public health. My work experience includes many diverse roles ranging from project management to working as a structural engineer, gaining diverse experiences. 
Outside my professional and academics, I am a horror aficionado. I love reading creepypasta, gaming, and discovering various genres of music and street photography. I believe itâ€™s our duty as humans to respect nature and work towards gaining harmony and world peace.
