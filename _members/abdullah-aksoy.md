Hello, I'm Abdullah, a junior structural and bridge engineer, and a Master's student at the University of Windsor. 

I'm passionate about tackling the challenges of structural material innovation, sustainable and recycled material design solutions, which are crucial in reducing
carbon footprint and energy consumption to combat the climate crisis. Let's roll up our sleeves and make a difference, eh!


Fun fact: Abdullah is an avid Avatar fan and aspires to construct bridges between two worlds, both figuratively and literally.
