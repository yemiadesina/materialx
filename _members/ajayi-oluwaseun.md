I am Oluwaseun Ajayi, a research student at the University of Windsor. 
My research interests encompass low-carbon materials, carbon capture, sustainability, and advanced structural analysis. 
With years of experience in structural modeling, analysis, and optimized design, I have worked on diverse projects, focusing specifically on timber, concrete, steel, and modular construction. 
I love hiking, traveling, and listening to music.
