My name is Reagan Farough and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at the University of Windsor in Mechanical engineering. With an interest in materials engineering, I am eager to grow in this field of study. In the coming years, I hope to contribute to innovations that will improve the sustainability of materials. 

Outside of academics, I play soccer in a women's league as a center-back. 

Something most people don't know about me is that I am a six-time national champion in the sport of jump rope!
